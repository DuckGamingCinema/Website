  <h4>Some things about me</h4>
    <p> Little things about me are that I love to play volley-ball and quite a bit of other sports.</p>
    <p> Computers has been a long living passion for me to get into.</p>
    <p> And since I had learned how to code properly and make my own website I thought why not.</p>
    <p> I built my first 3 computers and have starterd getting into keyboards. Hopefully soon I can be better at them though.</p>
    <p> And I have an amazing partner who I've spent almost 8 months with already. It just seems like time is flying by way to fast</p>
